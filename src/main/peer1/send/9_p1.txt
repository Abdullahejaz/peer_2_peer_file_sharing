Since January 2009, when Bitcoin v0.1 was released and announced on a cryptography
mailing list, there has been a growing interest on cryptocurrencies
from various communities related in some way with Information Technology.
In this section we will try to describe the main technical aspects at the basis
of what we called “blockchain-based systems”, at the current state of the art.
Before going into details it can be useful to recap Bitcoin’s basic strategy by
sketching its main operations. This can serve as a guideline before our diving
into the technicalities, and we hope it will induce the reader to focus on the
functional requirements pursued by the designers of these systems, rather than
on their actual implementations. Table 1 reports the main special symbols used
throughout the following, alongside with their meaning.Since January 2009, when Bitcoin v0.1 was released and announced on a cryptography
