In this work we will consider the opportunities given by the blockchain,
analysing its most relevant functionalities and known issues. We will evaluate
the features specific to Bitcoin, with the intent of pointing out the possible behaviours
that are not as efficient as they should when thinking with a broader
outlook. And we will consider some alternatives both in protocols and in systems,
which represent the already available solution to some acknowledged flaws.
More in details: in §2, we will review some new potential applications, surveying
the actual tools that are already implemented and focusing on their functionalities
related to the blockchain. Then in §3 we will stress the role of the transaction
concept in the actualization of the blockchain, followed by an inspection of the
components used to manage the public ledger, with a special look at the case
of Bitcoin. A discussion on some computational aspects will be presented in §4,
where some serious inefficiencies will be highlighted. Finally in §5 we will draw
our conclusions on the blockchain-based system.
