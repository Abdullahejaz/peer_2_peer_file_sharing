Since the validation of transactions relies upon digital signatures verified by
system nodes, and nodes are implemented through a special software termed
wallet, then there must be a mapping between wallets and (sets of) signature
verification keys.
Signature verification keys are often linked to identifiers or pseudonyms valid
only in the system context, called addresses, rather than real-life names and
identities as in public-key certificate (PKC) based infrastructures [25]. This way,
no trusted third party is required to ascertain the real identities of people and
devices involved in the system; moreover, users can hope for some anonymity.
Users’ anonimity is a (controversial) feature aimed by many cryptocurrencies,
and this is one reason for the possibility to have different user identifiers associated
with the same wallet. Actually, verification keys could be used bySince the validation of transactions relies upon digital signatures verified by
