The blockchain technology makes the execution of several smart contracts and
smart properties possible, enabling their reciprocal interaction in a decentralized
and distributed way. Decentralized autonomous organizations [5] operate
according to rules and procedures defined by smart contracts, and on the basis of
ownerships defined through smart properties. In these organizations, machines
and people can cooperate without the need to be incorporated into traditional
business identities.
The decentralized autonomous organization concept derived from Artificial
Intelligence: a decentralized network of autonomous agents perform tasks, which
can be conceived in the model of a corporation running without any human
involvement under the control of a set of business rules. Such organizations
can charge users for the services they provide, in order to pay others for the
resources they need. As long as they receive sufficient funds to operate on their
own, they can thus subsist independently of any third party. If a decentralized
organization is truly autonomous, no one (including its original creator) can
control it after it has been deployed on the blockchain. That is actually a very
threatening property: an organization could be conceived to evolve over time in
order to adapt to the context in which it operates, thus it can be very difficult
to know a priori if it can assume a dangerous state.
From a different point of view, the concept of decentralized autonomous
organization can actually be linked to the development of the Internet of Things
(IoT). The IoT will consist of billions of Internet-enabled devices, but not all can
be blindly trustworthy and some could be even malicious. In order to facilitate
private, secure, and (trustless) machine-to-machine coordination, these devices
will need a central reference point. In this context the ADePT (Autonomous
Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry) [17], by IBM and Samsung, is building a
proof of concept system for the next generation of the IoT
