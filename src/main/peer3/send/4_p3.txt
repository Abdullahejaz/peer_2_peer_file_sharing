It’s a miner task to collect new transactions that are taking place on the network
in the same time , and to assemble these transactions into a transaction block.
In Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, miners are totally free to choose which
transactions to include in their blocks. Most miners will consider any transaction
that reaches them over the network, assuming it includes an appropriate
fee, but nothing forces their choice. This freedom is intended to get resilience
and performance of the system in case of network delays or faults, since new
transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all miners, nor a miner
has to wait for a minimum of transactions in order to start on working on a new
block [3, 27]. Actually, it could be also the case that a miner with malevolent
intentions will decide to mine a block composed of just the generation transaction,
with the purpose of having a greater chance of getting that block inserted
in the blockchain. As we will see later, there are very few deterrents to a such
bad behavior, that would eventually result in lack of faith in the system (see
§3.6).It’s a miner task to collect new transactions that are taking place on the network
