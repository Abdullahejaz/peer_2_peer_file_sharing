However, the shift from single transactions to transaction blocks exposes
again the system to double-spending problems. Indeed, in the context of an
organization of recorded data in transaction blocks, chains of transfer paths
cannot be easily managed and validated through digital signatures as described
in §3.2. To overcome this difficulty, the designer(s) of Bitcoin introduced a new
chaining mechanism, in this case between different blocks.
Roughly speaking, it consists in inserting a cryptographic hash digest related
to the preceding block in the current block. Since a cryptographic hash digest
is supposed to correspond univocally to its originating data with overhelming
probability, then the above approach results in the circumstance that any tampering
in a given block involves changes in all its subsequent blocks. This way,
in order to achieve its purpose, a malicious miner has to be faster than the honest
miners in mining transaction blocks. Therefore the double-spending threat
is mitigated by making the mining of a transaction block a costly operation.
Overall, the management of the blockchain - that is, the collection of new
transactions and their insertion upon validation in the chain of previous blocks
- is a process composed of the following steps:
