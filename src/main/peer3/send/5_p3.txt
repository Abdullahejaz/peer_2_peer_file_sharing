In one form or another, mining is at the heart of any current blockchain-based
system. Mining is indeed the way the system imposes a computational cost
for the recording of new transaction blocks into the blockchain, so to mitigate
the double-spending threat. An important point to stress here, since often
misunderstood, is that the goal of a mining protocol does not actually consist
in the determination of the miner in charge of block recording, but rather of the
set of miners that are eligible for recording a new block in the blockchain (see
§3.6).In one form or another, mining is at the heart of any current blockchain-based
