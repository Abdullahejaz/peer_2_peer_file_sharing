The decentralized autonomous organization concept derived from Artificial
Intelligence: a decentralized network of autonomous agents perform tasks, which
can be conceived in the model of a corporation running without any human
involvement under the control of a set of business rules. Such organizations
can charge users for the services they provide, in order to pay others for the
resources they need. As long as they receive sufficient funds to operate on their
own, they can thus subsist independently of any third party. If a decentralized
organization is truly autonomous, no one (including its original creator) can
control it after it has been deployed on the blockchain. That is actually a very
threatening property: an organization could be conceived to evolve over time in
order to adapt to the context in which it operates, thus it can be very difficult
to know a priori if it can assume a dangerous state.The decentralized autonomous organization concept derived from Artificial
