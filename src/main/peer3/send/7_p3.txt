As we are going to better explain in §4, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work is a way to get
a valid and reliable transaction processing by ensuring that a set of peer nodes
(the miners) compete in solving a computational challenge within a preset time.
However, the problem to be solved is a kind of artificial puzzle of no practical
concern (besides, of course, the existence of the network), which requires an
increasing amount of computational resources over time, and where miners’
fitness is proportional to their hashing rate. In an attempt to overcome these
limitations, some alternatives for implementing a requirement like (2) have been
proposed over time, concerning both the underlying function used to compute
D and the way  is chosen. These alternatives were introduced mainly in an
attempt to mitigate threats deriving from accumulators of hashing power. A
single party, or a pool of them 4 could indeed invest in hardware equipment
to obtain a substantial percentage of the total hashing power, and with such
power they could succeed in double-spending by reversing the recent blockchain
history. Or alternatively they could carry out a denial-of-service by refusing to
include transactions in the block they generate, unless perhaps the transactions
useful to their own purposes.As we are going to better explain in §4, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work is a way to get
