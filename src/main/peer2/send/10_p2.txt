Notice that each transaction is limited on the number of computational steps
for the code execution it can generate, since those steps are proportional to the
transaction cost in ether. If a transaction execution “runs out of gas”, then
all state changes revert except for the payment of the fees; conversely, if the
execution halts with some gas remaining, then the remaining portion of the fees
is refunded to the transactor.
One of the high-level programming language used to write Ethereum contracts
is termed Serpent [8], which was designed to be very similar to Python. Unlike
the Bitcoin scripting language Script, Serpent is Turing-complete [33]; infinite
loops in code can indeed be avoided thanks to the fueling mechanism.Notice that each transaction is limited on the number of computational steps
