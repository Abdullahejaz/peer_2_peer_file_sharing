At its core, a cryptocurrency is a chain of digital signatures reflecting the coin’s
paths through the system. A key concept in this context is that of transaction,
which has an effect similar to a wire transfer between bank accounts. Actually
it is a data structure which represents a single addressable unit of a block, which
in turn is the single addressable unit of the blockchain. There are two different
types of transactions: standard transactions, which encode one or more coin’s
transfers from some transactor node to one or more recipient nodes of the system,
and generation transactions, where newly generated coins are granted by
the system to miners, as a reward for their effort in building the blockchain.
Every amount of currency which results from a transaction is seen as a pack
of coins which can be fractionated only through another transaction. Indeed a
standard transaction does not record a single fund transfer from one point to
another, but rather represents a scheme with multiple amounts which must be
balanced: the number of coins - possibly collected from different packs - representing
the requested amount for a given transaction must match the number
of coins made available for the possible multiple recipients. In fact also the
transactor itself can be considered the recipient of the eventual change, which
represent a new smaller pack of coins.
