The idea in Bitcoin was to assign the task of assessing the correct matching
of standard transactions to special nodes called miners, and to reward miners
for their work with some (optional) transaction fees plus new generated coins.
Thus, each miner must associate a generation transaction to the processed standard
transactions. Hence standard transactions are grouped together so that
they refer to the same generation transaction, thus the miner could eventually
be awarded with newly generated coins and relative transaction fees (see §3.2).
Moreover, it is better to group several standard transactions together, since the
network overhead could eventually grow in an unfeasible way if many transactions
ensues.
Following this idea, the “unit of mining” becomes the transaction block, a data
structure grouping one or many standard transactions (by one or more transactors)
with a single generation transaction. This is where the blockchain technology
comes into play.The idea in Bitcoin was to assign the task of assessing the correct matching
