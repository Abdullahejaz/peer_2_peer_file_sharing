To verify that inputs are authorized to collect the values of referenced outputs,
Bitcoin uses a scripting system which resembles to Forth []. With reference
to Figure 2, the input’s SgnCode (denoted as scriptSig in the code) and the
referenced output’s VrfCode (scriptPubKey) are evaluated, and the input is authorized
only if scriptPubKey returns true. Through the scripting system, the
transactor can create many different conditions that peers have to meet in order
to claim the output’s value. For example, it’s possible to create outputs that
can be claimed by anyone without any authorization, or that require multiple
signatures, or that can be redeemable with a password instead of a key.To verify that inputs are authorized to collect the values of referenced outputs,
