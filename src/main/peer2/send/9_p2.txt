Particularly relevant seems in this respect Ethereum (see §2.1), which uses its
own digital coin, called ether, to “fuel” the execution of applications stored on
its blockchain. Fueling is designed as a way to pay for the execution of Ethereum
bytecode and storage of data on the blockchain. How much a specific computation
will cost is defined by the complexity of the computation in term of its
basic operations, as follows. Basic operations such as addition, subtraction and
multiplication cost one “unit of gas”, as indicated by the parameter GASPRICE;
at the moment of writing GASPRICE = 10-6 ether. The Ethereum virtual ma-
chine (EVM), after the compilation of the code related to a given transaction,
computes the amount NUMBAOPS of its basic operations and fixes the total cost
for the transaction as:
